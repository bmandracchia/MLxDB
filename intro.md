#  Introduction to Machine Learning for Biomedical Data

This book is designed to introduce the fundamental concepts necessary for developing models that can assist in clinical decision-making by utilizing artificial intelligence techniques on various types of biomedical data. It begins with foundational machine learning approaches that rely on specific features extracted from biomedical data (feature engineering) and progresses to more contemporary methods using deep learning, which leverage "raw" biomedical signals or images to automatically learn the relevant features for predictive modeling.

The target readership includes students who are interested in applying machine learning techniques to process biomedical data. The book aims to provide an introductory guide on essential concepts that enable the development of tools which can serve as supportive systems for clinical decisions.
